# :wizard: shell

Shell extended from a university project in CS33 @ Brown.
Relatively rudimentary w.r.t. features, but could hypothetically 
be daily-driven, so to speak; was mainly written for fun/ out of interest.

Features naive command completions, aliasing, and history, amongst some 
others (whose implementations I would also describe as naive). 


TODO

 - Coloring: going to make the splash and prompt look a bit nicer. TERM colors are not the most
     vibrant/ conducive to a good graphic design, however.
